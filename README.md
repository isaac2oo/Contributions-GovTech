## Overview

Throughout my UI/UX design internship at GovTech Singapore, I was entrusted with a number of responsibilities which included assisting with user research and usability testing sessions, synthesising research findings through tagging and analysis, and identifying user insights and pain points.

In addition, I supported the design team by creating mockups for new features and refining existing interface components to improve usability and consistency across products.

This internship deepened my understanding of user-centered design within the public sector and gave me first-hand experience collaborating across product, research, and design functions to deliver meaningful digital solutions.
