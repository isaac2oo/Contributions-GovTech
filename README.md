# Contributions @ GovTech 👨‍💻

The following consists of a brief rundown of what I worked on during my internship stint at GovTech (Spring 24/25). 

## Disclaimer ⚠️

Due to the sensitive nature of the projects I contributed to during my time at GovTech Singapore, some information and materials have been intentionally left out in accordance with privacy and confidentiality policies.

I would be more than glad to walk you through my work via a call, so please feel free to reach out!

## Overview

Throughout my UI/UX design internship at GovTech Singapore, I was designated a variety of tasks which included assisting with user research and usability testing sessions, synthesising research findings through tagging and analysis, and identifying user insights and pain points.

I also supported the design team by creating mockups for new features and/or refining existing interface components to meet client needs and requirements.

### Context

SupportGoWhere functions as a one-stop portal for information regarding government schemes and services. Prior user testing research revealed a key pain point for users in which the overwhelming number of listing results caused confusion and made it challenging to navigate and identify suitable schemes and services.

### Contributions

In response, the team attempted to solve the issue via targeting 2 main aspects: 

> 1. Reorganisation of the Information Architecture (IA)
> 2. Redesigning the flow of the Category Pages

A Tree Test was used for Part 1 in order to validate and better understand the mental models of the user for the IA, while a Usability Test was implemented to evaluate the ease of use of the proposed redesigned Category Page flows.

My role in this was to assist with the facilitation, as well as scribing of the user testing sessions. 

## GatherSG

### Context

GatherSG in essence, consists of a suite of solutions and platforms designed to enhance case, customer, and service management across Singapore's government agencies. Currently a number of features and modules frequently utilised by users are situated on separate platforms, making it quite a hassle to 'switch' constantly from platform to platform. 

### Contributions

The team's current focus is in facilitating a seamless experience that aids users in their engagement workflow via the enhancement and redesign of currently available modules.

My role in this was to assist my supervisor and the team by handling tickets related to the redesign of current features and/or components, as well as coming up with new features and/or components should the need arise. The figure below shows the rough workflow and design process I go through each time when handling such tasks.

## Reflections

This internship granted me not just the opportunity to gain hands-on real-world experience, but also forced me to step out of my comfort zone and push myself to improve myself in terms of my UI/UX design knowledge and skills. I am extremely thankful to be part of such a professional setting where I can receive guidance from my peers and mentors within such a nurturing and conducive environment. This has greatly helped to further solidify my interest and passion in this field.
